# Getting Started Instructors

This guide will help instructors set up the Web App Template for HighTechU.

## Adding Students to the HighTechU GitHub Organization

You will need to invite each HighTechU Student to the HighTechU GitHub Organization. For more information, visit "[Inviting users to join your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization)".

> Note: It is important that HighTechU Students accept the invitation to join the organization to prevent access issues.

## Adding Students to the HighTechU Team

You will need to add each HighTechU Student to the appropriate team. Usually this team will reflect the current cohort. (For example, `Techccelerator`). For more information, visit "[Adding organization members to a team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team)".

## Creating the Repository

The HighTechU Web App Repository allows for GitHub users to create a new repository using this repository as a template. For more information, visit "[About repository templates](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#about-repository-templates)".

You will need to name the new repository appropriately, with either their team or app name:

`techccelerator-react-appname`

> Note: You will create the new repository as `private`. The repository will become `public` after the program is finished.

## Repository Permissions

You will want to restrict the `main` branch. You will need to create a branch protection rule. For more information, visit "[Creating a branch protection rule](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule)".

You will want to set up "Require pull request reviews before merging", "Required approving reviews: 1", and "Require review from Code Owners".

> Note: This is a crucial step! It is very important to limit HighTechU Students ability to push code to the `main` branch without review. This is to avoid broken code, publishing secrets, adding empty files, conflicts, and inappropriate contributions.

> Note: This means that developers cannot push to the `main` branch and that developers will need to develop on a separate branch and create a Pull Request. The information about Pull Request Workflow can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Repository Access

You will need to add each HighTechU Student to the repository (OR alternatively add the appropriate team). You will initially give them read and write access.

> Note: One person on each team (the SCRUM Master) will need admin access.

For more information about repository access for individuals, visit "[Managing an individual's access to an organization repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-an-individuals-access-to-an-organization-repository#managing-an-individuals-access-to-an-organization-repository)".

For more information about repository access for teams, visit "[Managing team access to an organization repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository)".

Please make sure that the rest of the HTU mentors have access to the team repos.

## Deployment to Firebase

Please follow the steps outlined on the *Deployment* section of [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md).

> Automatic deployments is still outstanding. We recommend using the HighTechUStudent Google account to deploy the projects manually after merging into main.

## Conclusion

The repository should now be ready for HighTechU Students to start developing and exploring.

## Support

The core staff are able to help with the set up, let us know if you need any help or assistance.
